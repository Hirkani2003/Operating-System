# Operating System (OS)

This repository contains bash scripts for different logical programs and C++ code for Page Replacement and Scheduling Algorithms.

## Description

This repository contains C++ programs for various scheduling and page replacement algorithms. Each algorithm has its own file and contains a bash script that compiles and runs the program. 

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are included in this repository:
### Page Replacement Algorithms
- First In First Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Page Replacement (OPT)
### Scheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling

### Bash Programs
